- 👋 Hi, my name is Rolyn Kropf.
- 👀 I’m interested in developing web applications and contributing to open source projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the fundamentals of Java, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects that have helped me in the past such as Inkscape or Libre Office. Open source is the best!
